    <p>I have been in veterinary practice now for nearly 25 years.
      Working with all animals latterly indulging my passion for
      large animal and especially equine work. I graduated initially
      from Durham University in Zoology and then went on to study veterinary
      medicine at Cambridge University. In 2018, I successfully completed an
      advanced practitioner certificate in equine practice.</p>

      I am married with two children, Ralph now 18years old who is involved in agriculture and Mary
      who is now studying for A-levels.
      Richard my husband is tremendously supportive and apart from doing all the cooking in the house
      helps with running the practice.

      Spare time is very precious and is filled with eventing Vigo pictured above who is rising 6 and has
      just started at BE 90 level. We are all mad keen hockey players too so weekends if not eventing
      are spent playing hockey.<br>
      You will see I have a co pilot travelling with me - “Olive” who is nearly a year old.

    <h4>DVM MRCVS Veterinary Surgeon</h4>
    <p>
      I am from Straffan, Co. Kildare, Ireland. I graduated from Szent Istvan University, Budapest.
      I moved to the United Kingdom to indulge my passion for Equine work and joined Allan Heath
      Equine Veterinary Surgeons in Louth, where I got to know some fantastic people across
      Lincolnshire. I completed the Twemlows Equine Reproduction Course and I am constantly upgrading
      my skill set to improve our services offered. I have been loving every minute since settling
      into the lovely way of life that people in this part of the world live.

    I have grown up steeped in horses and farming. My family Farm Weylands Stud
    has been breeding Thoroughbred Racehorses and Pedigree Texel sheep along with
    Suffolk and Cheviot sheep since 1978. In 2016 we bred the World's Top Rated Sprinter Limato,
    for which my Father won numerous awards. I am the eldest of three. My sister Rachel has a Degree in Botany
    from Trinity and is completing her Masters in Teaching. My brother Jonathan is doing a History and English
    Degree in UCD and has been a professional Rugby player playing with Munster and Saracens.

    I have been an avid sportsman since secondary school. I have played rugby, hurling, gaelic football, football and hockey.
    I am currently  playing with the Louth Hockey Club's Mens First team where we have won back to back promotions. I am extremely
    interested in all aspects of the bloodstock industry including Yearling preparation.
    I also love to spend time going out for a nice meal and I enjoy reading, sports, podcasts, horse racing and chatting with my family and friends.
