      I am married with two children, Ralph now 18years old who is involved in agriculture and Mary
      who is now studying for A-levels.
      Richard my husband is tremendously supportive and apart from doing all the cooking in the house
      helps with running the practice.

      Spare time is very precious and is filled with eventing Vigo pictured above who is rising 6 and has
      just started at BE 90 level. We are all mad keen hockey players too so weekends if not eventing
      are spent playing hockey.<br>
      You will see I have a co pilot travelling with me - “Olive” who is nearly a year old.
